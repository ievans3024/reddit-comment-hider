# Reddit Comment Hider
*Hide comments in terrible subreddits*

Don't you hate when the posts are good but the comments are utter trash heaps?

This is a tampermonkey user script I wrote after I got fed up with the pubescent boys flooding /r/Terraria with sexualized
content, sexist jokes, and shouting down anyone who questioned their ignorance and crass behavior.

Add the script to your browser's user script extension and set it to match your desired subreddits, using the
built-in match as a template. It'll automatically hide the entire comment section inside posts and add a button
for showing/hiding it.

I do not have hosting for the file at this time, so please be nice to github and don't hotlink to any github-hosted
resources.
